🔒 Challenges I Faced:
This was my first Java project, which made it rather difficult in the beginning.
originally struggled with the Java syntax, but after a couple Youtube tutorials,
I got the hang of it.
I also originally struggled with the schemas needed for the Doubly Linked List.

📄 Notes:
- I have added the Assignment Brief for reference.
- The .java files must be added to a package named 'assignment1' before running.
