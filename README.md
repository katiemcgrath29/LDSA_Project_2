# LDSA_Project_2
This is my Linear Data &amp; Scheduling Algorithms Project 2. 

<br/>
<br/>:mortar_board: **Implements the following:**
    <br/> 1. Divide and Conquer Algorithm
    <br/>2. Greedy Algorithm
    <br/>3. Merge Sort Algorithm
    <br/>4. Quick Sort Algorithm
    <br/>5. Heap of Binary Tries Algorithm
    <br/>6. Huffman Algorithm
<br/>
<br/>:lock: **Challenges I Faced:**
    <br/> I struggled with the Huffman algorithm, especially with the link to Heap of Binary Tries.
    <br/> The schema for the Divide and Conquer algorithm originally stumped me, but I figured it
    <br/> out in the end.
<br/>
<br/> :page_facing_up: **Notes:**
<br/> - I have added the Assignment Brief for reference.
<br/> - The .java files must be added to a package named 'assignment2' before running.
